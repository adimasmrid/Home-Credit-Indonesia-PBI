Final project based internship as Data Scientist at Home Credit Indonesia cooperates with Rakamin Academy

## Background  :
Recently, Home Credit endeavours to expand financial inclusion for the unbanked by providing a positive and secure lending experience, whereas some people do not understand or find the system difficult to apply for loans.

Home Credit uses various historical data to predict the repayment ability of customers. Therefore, some people who experience difficulties can be assured of a positive and comfortable lending experience,

By doing so, Home Credit will provide the best solutions for customers so that they do not experience problems during the loan process, both in terms of nominal price, payment date, and maturity date.

## Objective
    1. To use Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the data and identify the hidden trends, anomalies, patterns, or relationships within the data.

    2. To starts out with a high-level overview, then narrows into specific areas as we find intriguing areas of the data and find the important features in the dataset.

## What is in the Project
    1. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
    2. Feature Engineering 
    3. Feature Transformation
    3. Machine Learning

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Data Exploration is an open-ended process where we calculate statistics and create numbers to find trends, anomalies, patterns, or relationships within the data. The goal of Data Exploration is to learn what our data can tell us. 

In this project, EDA is used to display data correlation and data distribution, respectively:
    
    1. Univariate Analysis
    2. Bivariate Analysis
    3. Multivariate Analysis

## Feature Engineering 
Feature Engineering is the process of extracting and organizing the important features from raw data in such a way that it fits the purpose of the machine learning model. It can be thought of as the art of selecting the important features and transforming them into refined and meaningful features that suit the needs of the model.

In this project, technical features are used to manage data so that the application of machine learning is error-free, respectively:
    
    1. Duplicate data detection
    2. Handling Missing Values 

## Feature Transformation
Feature Transformation is it refers to the family of algorithms that create new features using the existing features. These new features may not have the same interpretation as the original features, but they may have more explanatory power in a different space rather than in the original space.

In this project, the Transformation Feature is used to transform data into numeric numbers, so that the application of machine learning can be applied to all data properly, respectively:

    1. Standard Scaler for Numerical Data Type
    2. Label Encoding & One Hot Encoding for Categorical Data Type 
    3. Oversampling & Under Sampling

## Machine Learning
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.

In this project, Machine Learning is used to predict on test data, there are several algorithms used, respectively:

    1. Logistic Regression
    2. Random Forest
    3. Extreme Gradient Boost
    4. K-Nearest Neighbor

# Summary
    
    1. All customers should be directed to repay loans on a revolving basis.

    2. Conduct further monitoring of customers, especially the nominal price of the    proposed loan, and the nominal income, because it has been found that customers who are not working and are on maternity leave, have the most problems in repaying loans.

    3. Create a campaign so that more students, accountants, the high skill tech staff, and managers are interested in applying for a loan
